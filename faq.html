      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">HOW DO I STOP THE IRS FROM LEVYING MY BANK ACCOUNT OR GARNISHING MY WAGES?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        When you hire us to represent you, the first order of business is to make sure that all IRS collection activities are ceased. 
        This process includes stopping future bank/other account levies. If there is a wage garnishment, we will negotiate another arrangement with the IRS. 
        Our goal is to stop ALL collection activities while we negotiate the best possible outcome for your unique tax problems. 
        We will work to provide peace of mind and protection for your assets.

      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">I HAVE A CPA SO WHY DO I NEED A RESOLUTION TAX PRACTITIONER?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Your CPA does accounting and tax preparation. He/she might have a tax resolution case here or there, and maybe even a tax audit or two. 
        They are probably seasonal, which means they are often around during tax seasons, but hard to reach once the tax season is over. 
        We are here year-round, even on Saturdays, and negotiating back taxes is our specialty!
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-xl p-5 border shadow-sm">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">THERE ARE SO MANY TAX RESOLUTION COMPANIES. WHY SHOULD I CHOOSE YOU?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Many tax resolution companies just want to get you in the door, and then they either outsource your case or pass it to an unlicensed customer service representative to finish it. 
        At The Tax Defense Group, your case will be handled in-house from the beginning to end. We review your case before assignment to determine which team will best represent your case. 
        Once we assign your case to a licensed Tax Practitioner and Assistant, you will have access to them by telephone, email, and text messaging.
      </p>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-xl p-5 border shadow-sm">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">WHAT STATES DO YOU WORK IN?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        The Tax Defense Group’s team of Tax Practitioners are licensed to work in all 50 States. Most business is conducted via telephone, email, and fax. 
        Since the IRS and State Revenue Agencies conduct collection procedures via mail and telephone correspondences, we do not need to be face-to-face to represent you.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-xl p-5 border shadow-sm">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">WHAT KIND OF TAXES DO YOU HANDLE?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        We handle IRS and State individual income taxes, business income/payroll/employment taxes, business sales & use tax, tobacco and cigarettes taxes, trust fund taxes and more.
      </p>

      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Your team of Tax Practitioner and Assistant will determine the best resolution program for you. They will review your finances and explain the process as well as the qualifications, 
        whether it’s an installment agreement, financial hardship or an offer in compromise. We don’t make promises or guarantee results without reviewing your complete financial situation and records.
      </p>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-xl p-5 border shadow-sm">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I HIRE YOU?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        We will protect you and negotiate by filing a Power of Attorney with the IRS and/or State Revenue Agency. 
        If necessary, your assigned Tax Practitioner will contact the IRS/State to obtain a collection hold on your account. 
        Once compliant, we review your financial situation and determine the best resolution for you.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-xl p-5 border shadow-sm">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">I HIRED YOU, WHY AM I STILL GETTING IRS NOTICES?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        By law the IRS has to send you notices letting you know about your tax liabilities. As Power of Attorney, we receive copies of the same IRS notices and will respond on your behalf.
      </p>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-xl p-5 border shadow-sm">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">I HAVEN’T FILED TAX RETURNS FOR YEARS, DO YOU FILE BACK TAXES?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Yes! We prepare and file Federal and State back taxes as well as the current year’s taxes.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-xl p-5 border shadow-sm">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">I DID NOT WORK AND DID NOT FILE, HOW CAN THE STATE SAY I OWE?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        If you have a professional or business license, the State will take the average income for that license, file a substitute tax return, and assess the tax liability. 
        Filing your original return could reduce or eliminate the liability.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-xl p-5 border shadow-sm">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">WILL I GO TO JAIL IF I CANNOT PAY MY TAXES?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        You could face jail time if the tax return and non-payment was done fraudulently or with criminal intent. You do not go to jail just for owing and the inability to pay.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-xl p-5 border shadow-sm">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">CAN I NEGOTIATE WITH THE IRS AND STATE MYSELF?</summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Yes, but it requires deep knowledge of IRS procedures and tax law. Our Enrolled Agents have decades of experience negotiating daily. DIY attempts often make matters worse.
